Markdown is a language for creating formatted text, it is commonly used all over the internet and internet based applications such as messaging services, forums, readme files, and other documentation. It features simple and easy to learn syntax which makes it widely accessible.
## This will explain some basic .md file syntax
 "# " creates a header 
 # this is a header
 "## " creates subheaders
 
 ## this is a subheader
 
 adding more # will create smaller and smaller subheaders
 
 #### (this header is made with four hashtags) Other syntax includes:

- add dash "-" to make bullet points

- add an image by using 
``![](path to image)``
for example, the markdown logo above is imported using the code ``![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110176257/181913887-4f213676-f449-486c-ad89-ae160abec694.png)``
- add a block of code by entering it between a pair of three `  symbols and putting the code inbetween them.
```
print("hello user") # introduction
firstname = input("please enter your first name: ")
print("your name is: ")
print(firstname)
```


- to name links add square brackets before link `[name of link](link_goes_here)`
